            <p>Across many ancient civilizations throughout the world, love was placed under the domain of a certain deity, usually,
                 but not in all cases, a goddess. In the Classical world, for instance, there were Venus and Aphrodite,
                  love goddesses of the Roman and Greek pantheons respectively. In the ancient Near East, love was personified
                   in such goddesses as Ishtar and Astarte. Further afield in West Africa, the Yoruba people believe in a love
                    goddess by the name of Oshun. One of the most important roles that Oshun plays is that of the goddess of the
                     sweet waters and the protective deity of the River Oshun in Nigeria. Alongside this river is a sacred grove,
                      probably the last in Yoruba Culture , dedicated to Oshun.</p>
